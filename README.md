## Technology Stack 

### Frontend:

- **React.js**: The user interface is built with React.js, allowing for a fast, responsive, and interactive experience. Reactâ€™s component-based structure is ideal for organizing the UI and ensuring reusability of components.
- **State Management**: State is managed using React hooks, ensuring smooth data flow and minimizing unnecessary re-renders.
- **HTML & TailwindCSS**: For structuring and styling the application. 

### Backend:

- **Node.js & Express.js**: The backend is built using Express.js, which handles API requests like user registration, appointment booking, doctor management, etc.
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens are used for securing routes, ensuring that only authorized users (patients, doctors, and admins) can access their respective functionalities.
- **MongoDB**: MongoDB is used as the database to store user data, doctor profiles, appointment details, and payment information.


### Payment Integration:

- **Stripe/Razorpay**: The payment gateway integration allows users to make payments for their appointments via Stripe or Razorpay, and the system securely processes these transactions.

### Security:

- **JWT & Bcrypt**: The system uses bcrypt to hash passwords and JWT for secure, token-based authentication. The app follows best practices for data validation to protect against security vulnerabilities.
